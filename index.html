				<h3 class="topic-heading">What is Github?</h3>
				<p class="topic-detail">To be very crisp about what exactly is GitHub, it is a file or code-sharing
					service to collaborate with different people.</p>
				<p class="topic-detail">GitHub is a highly used software that is typically used for <strong>version
						control</strong> . It
					is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Say for example, a software
					developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while
					working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where
					everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files.</p>
				<h3 class="topic-heading">What is Git?</h3>
				<p class="topic-detail">So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an important section to absorb, because
					if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will
					probably be much easier for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know
					about other VCSs, such as CVS, Subversion or Perforce — doing so will help you avoid subtle
					confusion when using the tool. Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to these other
					VCSs, Git stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and understanding these
					differences will help you avoid becoming confused while using it.</p>

					<p class="topic-detail">So, taken all together: Git vs. GitHub… what’s the difference? Simply put, Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them. </p>
					<p class="topic-detail">After all, in the world of programming, naming conventions aren’t always intuitive. That’s why it’s worth recognizing the connections and the differences in the similarly named Git and GitHub. Both Git and GitHub give programmers valuable version-control functionality so that they can build ongoing coding projects without being afraid of messing everything up. GitHub just takes things a little bit further than Git, offering more functionality and resources, as well as a place online to store and collaborate on projects.  </p>
